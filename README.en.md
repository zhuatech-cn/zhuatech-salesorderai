## 2026-10-23: Sales order line readiness calculation

This update implements **Sales order line readiness calculation** on the backend, with structured input, explicit validation, evidence or exception details, and a responsive utility page at `/practical.html`. Results are computed from submitted data, not fixed demo responses.

The new endpoint is disabled (503) until the administrator sets an independent 32–256 printable ASCII character ZHUATECH_PRACTICAL_TOKEN. Enter it in the utility page; it is kept only in page memory, never embedded in source or browser storage. Use `POST /api/practical/order-line-readiness`. No external model invocation or business posting occurs. See [algorithm, sample, boundaries and test commands](docs/AI_MULTIMODAL_UPGRADE_20261023.md).

**Search topics:** enterprise salesorderai, self-hosted salesorderai, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Sales, marketing, customer-success, service, and channel teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `database/` — database schema, migrations, or demonstration data
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- AI-related features must retain human review, provider configuration, traceability, and safe fallback behavior.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
